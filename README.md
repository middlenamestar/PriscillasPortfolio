# Priscilla's Portfolio

## Description

With this updated and restructured portfolio, the priority was to make the application mobile-responsive. All information is laid out very structurally, top to bottom, making it easy to digest. Simple design is the best design! Thank you and enjoy <3

## Usage

Simply scroll through the page to browse through resume and recent works, a little info about Priscilla, and lastly her contact information. Cheers :)
